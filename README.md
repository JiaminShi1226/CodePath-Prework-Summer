* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays a back sequence of clues including sound and visual cues for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess.

* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

I didn’t use any outside resources.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

When I was creating this project, the process of writing the code was relatively smooth. However, when I added the starGame() function, there were some spelling errors that caused me to spend some time looking for bugs, but the overall process of writing the code went smoothly. However, there were two problems at the end when I wanted to submit the assignment. The first problem was that there were some problems with recording the gif. I don't know why, but my computer wouldn't allow me to record too long gifs, so I had to split my gifs into several uploads. The second problem is that when I try to upload the code to GitHub, it keeps showing me that there are errors. But my process is all correct. Finally, I really didn't know what was wrong, so I had to restart my computer and re-upload the code. But then I realized that my code had actually been uploaded a long time ago, I just didn't know why it was reporting an error before. Anyway, the process of writing the code was smooth and the main challenge appeared in uploading the project. But fortunately, I was able to solve all these problems and finish the pre-work successfully.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

Before doing pre-work, I didn't have much experience in web development. I had only taken one web class at school, and it was online. I only had a very light understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. And I like to write HTML, CSS, JavaScript in one file, which makes my code look messy and unorganized. After doing pre-work, I found the beauty and practicality of writing in separate files. Js file, I wrote several functions, which also gave me a deeper understanding of JavaScript. I think it is necessary to do the pre-work because I have a general idea of what the internship will be like. I was also familiar with the content of the internship in advance.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

When I was playing this game, I didn't know how long I needed to play to win. This one is very irritating. So I would like to add the level setting. For example, one round counts as one level. Then tell the player in advance how many levels they need to play to win. I think this way is not easy to make players lose patience. Also, I would like to add audio with applause after the player wins, and audio with sighs of relief if the player fails. I think this would make the experience more enjoyable for the player.
